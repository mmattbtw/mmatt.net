AI TTS Donations is changing...

This announcement is containing 2 things:

1. The announcement of the "deprecation" to the existing AI TTS Donations program (the little Python program you know today)
2. The announcement of the future of AI TTS Donations.

First: **The existing v3.x.x AI TTS Donations program is, at this point, deprecated** This means that it will not receive new feature updates and such for the time being. This is simply because the script has gotten too out of control and the code base is simply too garbage and spaghetti that it's incredibly hard to keep working on it, and as all of you know, it's incredibly hard to setup for the streamer.

Second: **v5** _(skipping v4 because i can and v5 looks cooler)_

**v5** is going to be the new AI TTS Donations future. it's going to be a web app which means **no more python, no more downloads, no more configuration**. think of regular twitch alerts platforms (streamlabs, streamelements, etc.) _nerd stuff:_ it'll be built using TRPC, Next.js, Prisma, Cloudflare Workers, and Pusher. That's all the info I'm giving out for now :^)
**AI TTS Donations will remain 100% FREE AND OPEN SOURCE with this update.**
(more nerd stuff: here is an early little preview of how i'm thinking data will flow in v5: <https://arc.net/e/4A91AD3E-43F1-42B6-85AC-D2FB63404B47>)

The first glimpse of **v5** is available with this new front page! _its actually quite old at this point, but im just now making it known_ https://aittsdonations.mmattdonk.com/

you can sign up for the mailing list at the bottom and you'll get an email when **v5** is done!

**DO NOT THINK V5 WILL BE DONE SOON.** v5 is in the future, probably far future, but i'm just letting you all know the state of the app.

anyways go sign up for the list on https://aittsdonations.mmattdonk.com/ and hopefully the next announcement will be when this whole new thing is out :^)

_i will still be providing support for v3.x.x btw_
