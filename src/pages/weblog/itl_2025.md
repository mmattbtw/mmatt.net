# The What

ITL Online 2025 is an online, asynchronous event hosted by the [Internation Timing Collective](https://itc.dance?via=mmatt.net)! It is the biggest ITGmania event for all things tech and timing! Compiled of ~200 Community Made Charts from all sorts of packs curated by the talented ITL team, learn and perfect modern ITG Tech from lots of bangers in the pack.

Not an expert? Don't worry too much about competition, just have fun! Charts start at just ITG level 7s for both Singles and Doubles play. Have a fun time collecting Points from completing and perfecting your timing on these charts! It's a super fun event to learn dance gaming.

Old-timer getting back into Dance Games? ITL Online is the best time to come back into the game. With a pletheora of entry level to higher level charts, introducing you to all types of modern 4-Panel tech play. Compete with yourself to see if you can get those Quads! ‚≠ê

Expert Dance Gamer? You probably already know about ITL, hell you are probably on the first page of the Leaderboard, pls don't steal my points <\_<!!

# The Why

Why should you play ITL? It's fun!!! Even if you aren't into competition, getting together with the community to play all these charts together is such a fun experience. I can't just tell you "Its Fun Please Play", so you'll just have to trust me and _at least_ try it out.

# The How

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Play at a public cab? Don't have a [GrooveStats](https://groovestats.com?via=mmatt.net) account yet? Both of these are covered in [a previous blog post of mine.](/weblog/gg_usb)

## Prerequisites

1. A [GrooveStats Account](https://groovestats.com?via=mmatt.net).
   - Step 11 on my [previous blog post](/weblog/gg_usb) goes through all of this.
   - You can either use a USB/Local profile with your API key OR use the QR codes on the score screens.
2. A 4-panel dance pad.
   - No Keyboard Plays, sorry.
   - [Find an arcade with a StepMania Converted Cab on Z-i-V](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/arcades.php?via=mmatt.net) or [Buy yourself your own Dance Pad](https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/hardware/itg-dance-pads?via=mmatt.net)
3. [ITGmania 1.0.0+ w/ Simply Love 5.6.0+](https://itgmania.com?via=mmatt.net)
   - These are the supported versions for this year's ITL. Older versions may work for score submission, but it's recommended to update.
4. The pack downloaded and in your songs folder.
   - You can find the pack on [ITL's Website](https://itl2025.groovestats.com?via=mmatt.net) after you sign in under the "Downloads" section on the "Rules" tab.

## How To Play

### 1. Register on the ITL website.

- Just sign in using your GrooveStats account on the [ITL Online 2025 website](https://itl2025.groovestats.com?via=mmatt.net)

### 2. Turn on the FA+ Timing Windows.

- ITL Online is a timing event, which means we turn on the 15 ms Fantastic window (widely referred to as FA+).

#### 2.1 Go into options after choosing a song

- Press the green button twice.

#### 2.2 Go down to "Advanced Modifiers"

### 3. Play your charts!

- Note:
  - You must keep Decents + Way Offs enabled
  - use XMOD or MMOD when "No CMOD" is in the chart description
  - only 1.0x song rate mod (not scroll speed)
  - turn & visuals mods are okay (nothing that messes with the step counts)
  - play unlocks with friends and submit later when you unlock the chart.

### 4. Have Fun, and collect Points!

ITL is all about having fun, so don't forget it!

ITL Online 2025 started on March 14th, 2025 and will end on June 15th, 2025 at 2:59 AM PDT. You'll still be able to play the charts of course, and you'll be able to collect points in the "off-season", but eventually score submissions to ITL will close out.
