haven't listened to _too_ much of the deluxe yet to give any opinion, but this one is a classic

LOOOOOOOVED this new one from Four Tet, I find it a lot better than ["Loved"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6fUo4GlD0FbvXNTylA4o68?si=958447f706ba49a2) imo, still excited for the new record!

absolutely fucking AMAZING production with this new track from BeyoncÃ©. just devastating, so so good. excited for act ii!!! (however very sad to be losing dance music BeyoncÃ©, maybe some of the best music **EVER** in a **WHILE**. will love and stream act i for the rest of my life)

yeah yeah whatever BUT the WORST part of this song is def Kanye's rapping, he just doesn't sound good at allllll anymore and its very disappointing. (Like, I listened to Off The Grid today and the last verse Kanye delivers is one of his greatest in my opinion, next to No More Parties in L.A. and such, he sounded great there, but its just been a sharp downfall from then on) I actually do enjoy Ty Dolla $ign doing the hook here, very catchy. and the production is very fun. (obv don't endorse kanye's actions at all...)
