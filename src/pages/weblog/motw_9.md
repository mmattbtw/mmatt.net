## <span class="npf_color_ross">Music</span>

[Panavision by Roy Blair](https://cider.sh/share/song/1770781483)

well yes!!! I've actually... never listened to Roy Blair before the track, and I really like this one. The fact this track has production credits from CFCF, Deaton Chris Anthony, AND Instupendo like woah... he's tapped in, even more then me I fear. Excited to see where his new album takes him :D

[Why Lies by SOPHIE](https://cider.sh/share/song/1766808616)

One of the songs I liked more out of the new posthumous SOPHIE album. I have my thoughts about the album.... will I publish those, nope. Not worth it, fun track tho!

[Elevator Music: Swami Sound (DJ Mix) [Apple Music Exclusive]](https://music.apple.com/us/album/elevator-music-swami-sound-dj-mix/1772698910)

Ohhh hell yeah, I love Swami Sound as an artist, and this DJ set is incredible. He had been teasing it a while ago so I guess Elevator Music delayed it for some reason, but its FINALLY out and its so fun. Had to listen to this on the morning commute it made the drive so much better.

### Brat and it's completely different but also still brat

Ok so this album has practically taken over my life this week. It came out Thursday night and that's practically all I've been listening to for the day, its incredible. It's everything I wanted a remix album to be. I absolutely fucking adore the brat project, I think I'm gonna write a blog post about it, its just so good.

Here are my select standout (_new_) tracks:

- [Club classics featuring bb trickz](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767862946)
- [Sympathy is a knife featuring ariana grande](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767862948)
- [Everything is romantic featuring caroline polachek](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767862958)
- [Rewind featuring bladee](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767862963)
- [So I featuring a. g. cook](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767862966)
  - this one especially is so beautiful and amazing and fun for being such an emotional track. I love everything about this remix, its amazing.
- [B2b featuring tinashe](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767863300)
- [Mean girls featuring julian casablancas](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767863301)
- and of course... [365 featuring shygirl](https://cider.sh/share/song/1767863308)

ok so that's practically all of the new tracks... but they are all incredible so listen to them anyways.

## <span class="npf_color_chandler">Movies</span>

![Lady Gaga as seen in Joker: Folie à Deux](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/kKoB5K5sd0gH6PKaETeHSwDEv2K.jpg)

[**Joker: Folie à Deux**](https://letterboxd.com/air2earth/film/joker-folie-a-deux/)

Ok, this movie is not _as_ bad as everyone is making it out to be, it was pretty enjoyable to me. **BUT** I have **NOT** seen Joker (2019)... so this likely effects my opinion a LOT. Like sure I could see how the plot would be boring for someone coming from Joker (2019) (haven't seen the movie but I've heard enough to know its crazy), like I would probably be dissapointed if I was a fan of Joker (2019) and was waiting patiently for a new one. But like... its not as terrible 0/5 unwatchable garbage as everyone is making it out be. idk I enjoyed myself, maybe it was because I was just making fun of it with my friend in the theater lol.

another thing to note: **me and my friend were the _ONLY_ ones in the theater**. there were other seats reserved for our showing, and they didn't show up. we had the entire theater to ourselves. which is a... wild experience. I mean to be fair it was a Thursday night but like, brand new Joker movie and nobody is showing up????
