# media of the week is back!

media of the week is something I started on my Tumblr page near the start of this year, inspired by [Emergency Intercom](https://youtube.com/@emergencyintercom). At the end of each of their podcast episodes they talk about recent media (movies/music/etc.) they've been enjoing throughout their week since the last episode. I thought this was a fun idea so I totally stole it and started doing that series on Tumblr.

It was pretty fun! But at some point it just got annoying to keep up with every single week so I ended up missing weeks, and then delaying, and then I just stopped lol. But recently I've been thinking about getting this blog back up and running, but haven't really had anything I've wanted to talk about.

I finally had the idea to bring back media of the week to this blog because [Laker](https://laker.tech) posted about a new iteration in her [music blog series](https://glacier.pika.page/posts/music-ive-been-enjoying-recently-part-2) (idk how much of a series it is for her, but it inspired me none of the less) and that sparked something in me to start posting my media of the week series here!

All the previous iterations of my media of the week series are available here on this blog now! Right now, they are (almost) exactly how they looked like on Tumblr, which means that its filled with Spotify and YouTube embeds. In the future I'm just going to link to [song.link](https://song.link) as it shows every service that particular track is on. Maybe in the distant future I'll just be embeding [Songish](https://songish.app) posts :^\).

anywhom! I also want to make this blog a little more informal then it has been, like the only posts on here have been about [me explaining mastodon](./mastodon), [me explaining how to make a usb profile](./gg_usb), and [me announcing a new version of software that isn't even being developed anymore](./atd_v5). All of those posts are supposed to be very "formal" and "professional"... and other then that this blog has been pretty dead!! I don't want this blog to just be filled with like random think pieces and stuff, I want it to be **ME!!!** So that's what I'm hoping I can do with this effort.

all of the previous iterations of the series:

- [2/16/2024](./motw_1)
- [2/23/2024](./motw_2)
- [3/9/2024](./motw_3)
- [3/15/2024](./motw_4)
- [3/22/2024](./motw_5)
- [4/19/2024](./motw_6)
- [4/26/2024](./motw_7)
- [5/3/2024](./motw_8)

see you... tomorrow!
